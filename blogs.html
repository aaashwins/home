                            <p class="blog-card__text">
                                <h5>In the world where there is a lot of notifications, likes, comments, and people who might trigger us to react. The ability to stay calm is not everyone’s cup of tea.</h5>
                                Calmness is a state of mental, emotional, and physical peace. It’s the ability to remain composed 
                                and balanced, especially in stressful or challenging situations. It doesn’t mean absence of problems 
                                or chaos; rather, it’s about how you respond to them.
                            </p>
                            <p class="blog-card__text">
                                I used to think being calm meant staying silent—speaking only when necessary, keeping my words 
                                brief, and never reacting too quickly. I would sit quietly in my friend group, watching conversations 
                                unfold around me, barely contributing. I convinced myself that this restraint was calmness, that I was 
                                composed and in control. Silence became my shield, a way to avoid conflicts and maintain an illusion of 
                                peace.
                            </p>
                            <p class="blog-card__text">
                                But one day, it hit me. If being silent is calm, then a mute person must live in perfect calmness 
                                their entire life. That thought stayed with me and started unraveling my idea of what it truly 
                                means to be calm. I realized calmness isn’t about how much or how little you speak. It’s not about 
                                silence at all.
                            </p>
                            <p class="blog-card__text">
                                Calmness is about how you feel inside. It’s the ability to speak with intention and listen 
                                with presence. It’s about not letting your emotions control your words, not reacting impulsively, 
                                but responding with clarity. You can be calm and still speak freely. You can be calm and still 
                                express yourself fully.
                                Being calm is a state of mind, not a lack of sound. It’s the space between reaction and response, 
                                the breath you take before you speak, the steadiness you find in chaos. And that’s when I stopped 
                                measuring my calmness by the silence around me and started cultivating the calm within me.<a href="https://medium.com/@ashwin787/the-art-of-staying-calm-in-a-chaotic-world-bbebb3b56d0a">...read more on medium</a>

                                What you are seeing and hearing right now is nothing but a dream. You are dreaming in this very moment—with your brain awake. 
                                Dreaming is the primary function of the mind—it dreams 24 hours a day. 
                                It dreams when the brain is awake, and it dreams when the brain is asleep

                                Last year, when I was working at a café owned by my friend, my daily habits were quite different. 
                                I would wake up around 9 in the morning, take a shower, and then take a 10-minute walk to the café 
                                from my apartment.
